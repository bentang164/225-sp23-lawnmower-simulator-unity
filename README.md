# Lawnmower Simulator
## COMP 225-01: Software Design and Development

Unity prototype of Lawnmower Simulator. Features:
- Lawnmower movement and rotation based on direction
- Collisions with game objects such as the world barrier

This prototype was created under the assumption that the grass would use a tilemap; changes will need to be made for other methods.
